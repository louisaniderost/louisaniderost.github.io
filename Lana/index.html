<p>I am 18 years old. I was born on March 21, 2004 in Cagayan de Oro, Philippines. During my senior year of high school, I graduated from Lourdes College and pursued the ABM strand, which stands for Accountancy, Business, and Management. And now I am currently studying at the University of Science and Technology of the Southern Philippines and taking up a Bachelor of Science in Technology Communication Management (TCM). I chose this course because it facilitates students in acquiring and enhancing relevant knowledge and skills to achieve Technology Communication and Management.</p>
